# ToDo App
  
This project includes TypeScript, Vite, and CSS Modules.

## TypeScript

We are using TypeScript version 5.2.2 for this project. TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It provides the benefits of optional static type-checking along with the latest ECMAScript features. 
## Vite 

For the build tool, we're using Vite version 5.0.8. Vite provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It leverages JavaScript's native ES modules (ESM) support, allowing us to serve code without bundling, offering us a significant development speed-up.
## CSS Modules

We are also using CSS Modules for styling our components. CSS Modules is a CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default. By using CSS Modules, we avoid conflicts in the global scope and can still reap the benefits of CSS.
## Running the Project

To start the development server, run: npm run dev
